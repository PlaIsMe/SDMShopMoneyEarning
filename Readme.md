# SDM Shop Money Earning

**SDM Shop Money Earning** is a lightweight Minecraft mod that allows players to earn in-game money by slaying hostile monsters. Perfect for RPG-style progression or shop-based economy systems.

## ðŸ’° How It Works

- Only **hostile mobs** can drop money when killed.
- **Passive or neutral mobs** do **not** reward money.
- Hostile mobs with **less than 20 health** do **not** reward money.
- The **money reward** is calculated using the formula:

```
**Money Earned = Mob Health / 10**
```


For example:
- Killing a zombie with 20 health â†’ **2 money**
- Killing a boss with 100 health â†’ **10 money**
